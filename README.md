_Choose Your Own Adventure series_

The 21st century is known for its interactive art, where the boundaries between audience and performers are blurred thanks to the use of technology. 
However, such openness in a work of art was also part of experimental projects in the previous century. 
For example, so-called gamebooks were designed as interactive stories in which the reader could decide the fate of the characters by choosing narrative paths at the end of each chapter.
In A Gothic Gamebook, the audience will write the story of a young couple in love according to the tropes of early 19th-century Gothic literature. 
For each possible scene, the musicians prepare several songs from the German Romantic song repertoire. The music itself is full of references to magic, fantastic creatures, ghosts and horror.

This musical game, or game piece, will be presented on Sunday 30 November during the [Oddities & Rarities festival](https://orpheusinstituut.be/nl/nieuws-en-events/oddities-rarities) at Orpheus Instituut.
